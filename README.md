## Projects

### Image classification project
- Developed a Keras-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying CIFAR-10 dataset images.
- Achieved a test accuracy of 92.9 percent post-training over 50 epochs, demonstrating robust image classification capability.
- Utilized diverse layers including Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, and Dropout, enhancing model's ability to capture intricate image features.
- Implemented techniques like one-hot encoding, data normalization, and Adam optimizer (learning rate: 0.001) for efficient training and improved performance. Additionally, evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix for comprehensive insights.
- Utilized TensorFlow within Keras to power neural network operations, enabling smooth model development, training, and evaluation for image classification.
